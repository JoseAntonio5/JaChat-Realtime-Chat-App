# JaChat Realtime Chat App üí¨

##  About The Project üìñ
This project is a real time chat application created using Socket.IO, which is an amazing library that enables real-time, bi-directional communication between web clients and servers. I used [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Express](https://expressjs.com/) to create a webserver and handle the socketIO logic, and HTML, CSS and JavaScript to show the output on the user screen.
