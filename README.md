##  About The Project üìñ
This project is a real time chat application created using Socket.IO that is an amazing javascript library that enables real-time, bi-directional communication between web clients and servers. I used [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Express](https://expressjs.com/) to create a webserver and handle the socketIO logic, and HTML, CSS and JavaScript to show the output on the user screen.

### Basic Features
- Users can enter a username and join a room.
- There are many different chat rooms.
- Chatting in real-time.
